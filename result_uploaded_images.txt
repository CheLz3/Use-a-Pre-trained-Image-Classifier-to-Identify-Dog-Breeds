Total Elapsed Runtime for alexnet/resnet: 0:0:15
Total Elapsed Runtime for vgg: 0:0:18

Given our results for uploaded images, the "best" model architecture can be either alexnet or resnet. Even though the percentage of classification between all 3 models where the same, the run time for vgg was higher than that of alexnet/resnet.
